## FizzBuzz directory

Dedicated to Tom Scott. Please check out [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc).

Here is the rule of the game. Please understand that I change a little bit the rule of this game. Tom Scott's version is only to 100 and three prime multiples.

## About this directory

This is the proposal of the FizzBuzz game. I intended to explain the game using my own word. Credit to Tom Scott and his video. I also write some of the version of the answer. These are mine, unless stated otherwise.

The name using in this directory is a way for me to credit Tom and Imran for their proposal and video. I have not done it, nor made aware any of it before I watch his video. As the level increase, the difficult of the coding

You want to do it? Great. Fork this, open an issue and I will add your repo in the end of this README.

This is a really good test to see your personalities and your programming style.

## So how about the challenge?
There are 5 levels. Except number 1 and 2, the rests are my proposals. I hope you can enjoy.

## Level 1: Classical version, proposed by Imran
Tom and Imran is playing a counting game, from 1 to 100. If a number is a multiple of 3, say them 'Fizz'; if a multiple of 5, say them 'Buzz'; if both, say 'FizzBuzz'. For example, from 1 to 20, they will count like this:

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz.
```

Write a program export Fizz and Buzz from 1 to 100. You can extend it to 1000 or larger if you wish.

## Level 2: Three prime multiples, by Tom Scott

The same game, but with a multiple of 7, you add 'Banana'.

For example, with 7 replaced with 'Banana'; 21 with 'FizzBanana', 35 with 'BuzzBanana', 105 with 'FizzBuzzBanana'.

Write a program export from 1 to 500. Extend the limit larger, if you wish. You can also add more prime factors to check, like 11, 13 and so on.

## Level 3: Composite and prime multiples
Tom and Imran is going to make it harder. Now they change the whole game.

They keeps 3 and 5 multiples, but every time a multiple of 6 appears, they want to add 'Orange' instead. From 1 to 30, the new counting will look like this:

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Orange, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Orange, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, BuzzOrange.
```

Write a program export those numbers from 1 to 100. You are allowed to have BuzzOrange and OrangeBuzz. You can also make it harder by sticking into one phrase.

## Level 4: Prime vs Composite
Now replace prime with 'Prime' and Composite with 'Composite'. Other than that, export the number.

Range: from 1 to 100 (recommended). You can also change the problem to finding the next prime, if you wish.

## Level 5: Composite number
Check a number, print all the factors out, and say if it is prime or not.

Range: from 1 to 100 (recommended). Make a for loop if you wish, or just check one number.

## FAQ

> Why these languages?

Because I like those. Those are the one that I know, especially Pascal, the one that I have been taught in school.

> What are you trying to archive?

I have trying to pass some free time.

> Why Tom Scott?

I have recently discovered his video in the series called "The Basic", which mention everything in "the basic". Personally, I really love his channel. No adverisement here, but credit to where it dues.

> Can I ask more about this and/or give mine?
Yes. Please open an issue.

>Why WTFPL?

As if I care, these are not mine. These versions have been around for a while. Some of it may be proposed, but it just that I wrote this by myself.

However, a mere thing like this worth nothing to make it copyright. I was going to send this to Tom Scott and have him shout out about this challenge.

>Is it worth to take this challenge?

If you are trying to learn programming and math, it is worth to try. However, there are more exercises than you think. Just google some exercise and do a little bit of it.

Good luck with your programming life.
