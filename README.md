## FizzBuzz directory

Dedicated to Tom Scott. Please check out [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc)

Here is the rule of the game. Please understand that I change a little bit the rule of this game. Tom Scott's version is only to 100 and three prime multiples.

## About this directory

This is the proposal of the FizzBuzz game. I intended to explain the game using my own word. Credit to Tom Scott and his video. I also write some of the version of the answer. These are mine, unless stated otherwise.

The name using in this directory is a way for me to credit Tom and Imran for their proposal and video. I have not done it, nor made aware any of it before I watch his video.

You want to do it? Great. Fork this, open an issue and I will add your repo in the end of this README.

License: WTFPL.

## Why WTFPL?
As if I care, these are not mine. These versions have been around for a while. Some of it may be proposed, but it just that I wrote this by myself.

However, a mere thing like this worth nothing to make it copyright. I was going to send this to Tom Scott and have him shout out about this challenge.

## So how about the challenge?
There are 6 levels. Except number 1 and 2, the rests are my proposals. I hope you can enjoy.

## Level 1: Classical version, proposed by Imran
Tom and Imran is playing a counting game, from 1 to 100. If a number is a multiple of 3, say them 'Fizz'; if a multiple of 5, say them 'Buzz'; if both, say 'FizzBuzz'. For example, from 1 to 20, they will count like this:

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz.
```

Write a program export Fizz and Buzz from 1 to 100. You can extend it to 1000 or larger if you wish.

## Level 2: Three prime multiples, by Tom Scott

The same game, but with a multiple of 7, you add 'Banana'.

For example, with 7 replaced with 'Banana'; 21 with 'FizzBanana', 35 with 'BuzzBanana', 105 with 'FizzBuzzBanana'.

Write a program export from 1 to 500. Extend the limit larger, if you wish. You can also add more prime factors to check, like 11, 13 and so on.

## Level 3: Composite and prime multiples
Tom and Imran is going to make it harder. Now they change the whole game.

They keeps 3 and 5 multiples, but every time a multiple of 6 appears, they want to add 'Orange' instead. From 1 to 30, the new counting will look like this:

```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Orange, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Orange, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, FizzBuzzOrange.
```

Write a program export those numbers from 1 to 100.

## Level 4: Composite and prime multiples 2
Now they wants to make everything harder. If it is a multiple of 6, they only want Orange, not Fizz.

Range: from 1 to 100 (recommended).

## Level 5: Prime vs Composite
Now replace prime with 'Fizz' and Composite with 'Buzz'. Other than that, export the number.

Range: from 1 to 100 (recommended).

## Level 6: Composite number
Check a number, print all the factors out, and say if it is prime or not.

Range: from 1 to 100 (recommended).
